# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that aim to create software that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in software development to improve code quality. Here's a brief overview of each principle:

# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 
This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job. If a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes harder to maintain and modify.

# Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
The OCP suggests that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a system without altering existing code.

# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
According to this principle, objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a subclass should be substitutable for its base class without causing issues.

# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): 
The ISP advises that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. In other words, it's better to have smaller, more specific interfaces than one large, monolithic interface.

# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): 
The DIP emphasizes that high-level modules (e.g., business logic) should not depend on low-level modules (e.g., specific implementations) but rather both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes). This promotes decoupling and flexibility in your code.

These SOLID principles, when followed, help in writing maintainable, flexible, and scalable software. They are foundational concepts in software engineering and are often used alongside design patterns to create robust and clean code.
